# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
There was a request by Louise to analyze crowdfunding data. She is starting a new play called Fever with an anticipated budget of over $10,000. She wants us to determine if there are specific factors that will make her crowdfunding project successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When isolating the theater crowdunfing category, projects that launched in May are the most successful with 66.9% reaching their goal. This is followed by June and July with 65.4% and 63.0% respectively. ![Chart](/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
If you look at the subcategory of plays, things change a little bit. June is the most successful month with 70.3% followed by May and March with 68.9% and 68.7% each. Overall for the plays subcategory all months are above 61% success except for December which is only at 48.2%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at goal dollar amount of the plays subcategory the greatest success was had when the goals were less than $5,000. Goals under $1000 were 76% sucessful, while projects with goals in the $1000 to $5000 range were 73% sucessful. The next closest goal range was $35,000-$45,000 obtaining a 67% success rate. ![Chart](/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
