# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
There was a request by Louise to analyze crowdfunding data. She is starting a new play called Fever with an anticipated budget of over $10,000. She wants us to determine if there are specific factors that will make her crowdfunding project successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When isolating the theater crowdfunding category, projects that launched in May are the most successful with 66.9% reaching their goal. This is followed by June and July with 65.4% and 63.0% respectively. ![Chart](/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch_percent.png)

If you look at the subcategory of plays, things change a little bit. June is the most successful month with 70.3% followed by May and March with 68.9% and 68.7% each. Overall for the plays subcategory all months are above 61% success except for December which is only at 48.2%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at goal dollar amount of the plays subcategory the greatest success was had when the goals were less than $5,000. Goals under $1000 were 76% successful, while projects with goals in the $1000 to $5000 range were 73% successful. The next closest goal range was $35,000-$45,000 obtaining a 67% success rate. ![Chart](/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

the main challenge that I encounter is that the launch date charts that were asked for, I felt didn't tell the whole story. To overcome this, I created a couple additional charts that I felt told that story more effectively. These charts are discussed below. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The main conclusion is that the best time to launch a Theater category or specifically a Theater/Play category project is in May or June. These months are #1 and #2 for both the theater category and plays subcategory. On the other end of the spectrum the worst time to launch a crowdfunding campaign is in December. December is the worst month by at least 10% when compared to any other month when looking at just play campaigns. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The ideal goal range for projects in the plays subcategory is less than $5,000. Combined these 2 goal groups will be successful 73.4% of the time. Once you step up to the next goal bracket of 5-10k, you drop to a 55% success rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It's hard to account for the amount of work that each project owner put into their crowdfunding campaigns. This effort would contribute to the success of a campaign and we can't account for it. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I did create a couple extra graphs that I found more useful in my analysis. I duplicated the theater vs launch chart, but I changed it to percentage instead. Comparing percentages is makes more sense to me than just comparing straight counts. It tells a more complete story, because you might have a higher success count in a month but if more campaigns fail then is it really the best month? I also created a plays vs launch date chart using percentages. It also might be beneficial to look at average number of backers by launch and by goal range.
